This project is a part of the curriculum of software engineering for the low-level programming module at Holberton School.

Synopsis
This repository holds all the code necessary for our custom simple shell to run. Our shell currently handles the executions of executables found in the environmental variable PATH, with or without their full paths. Sample commands that our shell supports include ls (/bin/ls), pwd, echo, etc. We've also created the following builtins.

Builtins
exit exits shell (Usage: exit [status])
env prints environmental variables (Usage: env)
help shows the help menu or help for specific command (Usage: help or help name value)
cd changes directories (Usage: cd [-][~][path])
Authorized functions and system calls:
* access (man 2 access)
* chdir (man 2 chdir)
* close (man 2 close)
* closedir (man 3 closedir)
* execve (man 2 execve)
* exit (man 3 exit)
* fork (man 2 fork)
* free (man 3 free)
* stat (__xstat)(man 2 stat)
* lstat (__lxstat)(man 2 lstat)
* fstat (__fxstat)(man 2 fstat)
* getcwd (man 3 getcwd)
* getline (man 3 getline)
* kill (man 2 kill)
* malloc (man 3 malloc)
* open (man 2 open)
* opendir (man 3 opendir)
* perror (man 3 perror)
* read (man 2 read)
* readdir (man 3 readdir)
* signal (man 2 signal)
* strtok (man 3 strtok)
* wait (man 2 wait)
* waitpid (man 2 waitpid)
* wait3 (man 2 wait3)
* wait4 (man 2 wait4)
* write (man 2 write)
* _exit (man 2 _exit)
* isatty (man 3 isatty)
* fflush (man 3 fflush)
Compilation
Our shell will be compiled this way:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

And it has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in a VirtualBox on it via Vagrant(2.2.14) using the Betty style.

Activate the shell
(your_terminal)$ ./hsh
$
Sample Usage

$ ls -al
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   234 Mar 28 19:32 file1.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    69 Mar 28 19:32 file2.c
$ echo "This is a pretty cool!"
This is pretty cool!
In non-interactive mode, the shell is run from commands being piped in. The subshell is only opened as the command is carried out and closes at the completion of the command.

echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   234 Mar 28 19:32 file1.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    69 Mar 28 19:32 file2.c
